    <!-- 
        >> Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities and other circumstantial limitations can use them with as few barriers as possible
        >> Situational limitations are a little different
        >> Using a phone outside on a bright day, browsing a site with one hand while you’re busy doing something else with the other, or living in an area where the internet is slow or the bandwidth is expensive are all examples of situational limitations
        >> These limitations, unlike a disability, occur to users only in specific situations, but are still important to keep in mind when developing a website
        
        >> Why Web Accessibility Matters: 
        typo >> multi-story (multi storied)
        >> When you develop a website, you’re developing it for users, and you need that website to actually be usable by them (disablity, short term limitations diasblilty prone people)
        >> People with disabilities, older people with changing abilities, people who aren’t as tech savvy, and people with some sort of situational limitation are still users, and websites should be as equally usable by them as possible
        >> depending on the country, there could actually be laws requiring accessibility to be implemented

        Diverse Abilities and Barriers: 

        >> Diversity of abilities: 
        >> There are many reasons why people may be experiencing varying degrees of auditory, cognitive, physical, speech, and visual disabilities
        >> there are many variations such as: 
            >> Age-related impairments, Multiple disabilities, Health conditions, Changing abilities, Temporary impairments, Situational limitations
        >> Websites and web tools designed for people with a broad range of abilities benefit everyone, including people without disabilities
        >> It is, therefore, important to consider the broad diversity of functional needs rather than to categorize people according to medical classifications
