        >> Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities and other circumstantial limitations can use them with as few barriers as possible
        >> Situational limitations are a little different
        >> Using a phone outside on a bright day, browsing a site with one hand while you’re busy doing something else with the other, or living in an area where the internet is slow or the bandwidth is expensive are all examples of situational limitations
        >> These limitations, unlike a disability, occur to users only in specific situations, but are still important to keep in mind when developing a website
        
        >> Why Web Accessibility Matters: 
        typo >> multi-story (multi storied)
        >> When you develop a website, you’re developing it for users, and you need that website to actually be usable by them (disablity, short term limitations diasblilty prone people)
        >> People with disabilities, older people with changing abilities, people who aren’t as tech savvy, and people with some sort of situational limitation are still users, and websites should be as equally usable by them as possible
        >> depending on the country, there could actually be laws requiring accessibility to be implemented
     -->

    <!-- 
        Diverse Abilities and Barriers: 

        >> Diversity of abilities: 
        >> There are many reasons why people may be experiencing varying degrees of auditory, cognitive, physical, speech, and visual disabilities
        >> there are many variations such as: 
            >> Age-related impairments, Multiple disabilities, Health conditions, Changing abilities, Temporary impairments, Situational limitations
        >> Websites and web tools designed for people with a broad range of abilities benefit everyone, including people without disabilities
        >> It is, therefore, important to consider the broad diversity of functional needs rather than to categorize people according to medical classifications

        
      -->

    <!-- 
        THE WEB CONTENT ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES (WCAG)
        >> WCAG exist in order to help create a shared standard when it comes to web accessibility
        >> Think of web accessibility as the destination, and the WCAG as one of the tools that can help get us closer to it
        >> It’s important to understand that while the WCAG can be incredibly helpful for building an a11y foundation, they are not the finish line when it comes to accessibility
        >> Like the name says, they are simply guidelines, and they will only help us make websites more accessible

        Four Principles: 
        >> WCAG are organized around four, core principles that should be kept in mind when implementing any sort of accessibility feature: 
            >> Perceivable: 
                >> Users must be able to perceive the information or user interfaces being presented
                typo >> For example, Light (light) text on a light background could be difficult for some users with a visual impairment to perceive
            >> Operable: 
                >> Users must be able to operate any user interfaces or navigation, and interfaces cannot require an interaction which the user cannot perform
                >> A navigation bar with drop-down menus that only expand when a mouse cursor hovers over them, for example, would not be operable by keyboard users giving those menu items focus
            >> Understandable: 
                >> Users must be able to understand any information or user interface that is presented to them
                >> For example, if a user tried submitting a form and received an error such as “Error 113: Bad data”, they wouldn’t be able to understand what the error actually means or how to fix whatever caused the error
            >> Robust: 
                >> Content must be accessible by current assistive technologies and other user agents, and must remain accessible as those technologies advance

        Conformance Levels: 
        >> WCAG has three different conformance levels, each of which is made up of various success criteria, or rules, that must be followed in order to successfully meet that level of conformance
            >> Level A: 
                >> essential support, is the minimum level of conformance for the WCAG
            >> Level AA: 
                >> ideal support, is the level many organizations strive for
                >> Meeting this level also requires meeting Level A
            >> Level AAA: 
                >> specialized support, isn’t recommended for entire sites to meet in full, as some content may make it impossible to meet this conformance level
                >> Meeting this level would require also meeting both Level A and Level AA

        typpo >> The goal of these lessons is (are) just to introduce you to some of the more common or simpler concepts that you should get into the habit of checking for moving forward
        (Before) Implementing Accessibility: 
        >> first thing to keep in mind is that no site will ever be 100% accessible
        >> second thing to keep in mind is that just taking those first few steps towards creating accessible websites matters just as much as the many more steps you’ll take in the future

    <!-- 
        SEMANTIC HTML

        introduction: 
        >> As useful as <div> and <span> elements can be as generic containers, they’re not always the most a11y friendly elements to use
        >> While it may be tempting or easier to just use them for everything, from containers to interactive areas, you should not only check whether there is a more appropriate element to use in certain situations, but also whether you’re using an element correctly

        Importance of Semantics:
        >> In terms of web accessibility, using semantic HTML is important because it provides meaning and context
        >> Some elements have a semantic meaning, but don’t really provide any context when announced by assistive technologies, such as the <p> element
        >> Then there are elements that have a semantic meaning and are announced with some sort of context to help users perceive or operate them, like a <button>
        >> <div> and <span> elements, most likely two of the more common elements you use, are semantically neutral
            >> That is, they themselves have no semantic meaning and provide no context on their own to assistive technologies, which can make it more difficult for users of such technologies to perceive, operate, and understand them
            >> Don’t let this lack of semantics and context make you feel like you can never use a <div> or <span> ever again, though
            >> They still have their uses as generic containers, such as for layouts or for generic text
        >> consider this given snippet: 
            <-- These are buttons... right? ->
            <div class='button-container'>
                <div class='rock'>Rock</div>
                <div class='paper'>Paper</div>
                <div class='scissors'>Scissors</div>
            </div>
            >> A sighted user would most likely have no trouble playing the game if the elements looked like something to interact with
            >> A screen reader user, however, would have no idea what any of these elements mean
            >> screen reader would announce the text contents of the element (“Rock”, “Paper”, or “Scissors”), and the user might think it’s just plain text on the page and move on
            >> There’s no context to tell the user that they’re supposed to, or that they even can, interact with these elements
            >> This issue can be easily fixed by using semantic HTML: 
                <-- Okay, these are *definitely* buttons ->
                <div class='button-container'>
                    <button class='rock'>Rock</button>
                    <button class='paper'>Paper</button>
                    <button class='scissors'>Scissors</button>
                </div>
            >> Because the <button> element has a semantic meaning and provides context, a screen reader would announce the text content as well as the role of the element: “Rock, button”

        Using Semantic HTML Correctly: 
        >> When it comes to using semantic HTML correctly, you want to think about what your intent for users is and what context you want (or need) to provide to them
        >> This can vary depending on the situation, but there are some things you should absolutely be checking for moving forward: 
            >> If a user is meant to click something, whether it’s an actual button or not, you will usually want to use a <button> element
                >> This will let the user know that they can interact with the element by clicking on it
            >> If you want to provide some sort of tabular data to a user, use a <table> element along with the elements related to it
                >> This will allow a user to more easily navigate and understand the data being presented
            >> When you use an input element, you should always create a relationship between it and a <label> element
                >> A <label> provides context for what an input actually means to assistive technologies, announcing the label contents each time the input is announced
                >> Not only that, but a proper <label> increases the clickable area of the input itself, which is useful for users who have trouble clicking on smaller items
                >> There are two ways you can create this relationship: 
                    <-- Useful when you need the input itself to have an ID ->
                    <label for='name'>Name</label>
                    <input type='text' id='name' />

                    <-- Look, Ma, no ID! ->
                    <label>
                    Name
                    <input type='text' />
                    </label>
            >> you should always use the type for "input" that makes the most sense for its intended use
                >> type="text"makes more sense for a name or address field, while type="email" or type="tel" would of course make more sense for an e-mail or telephone field, respectively
                >> For certain devices, using the correct type may show only the required or additional characters on the keyboard
                >> A type="tel" input, for example, might make it much easier for users to fill out their phone number by providing larger, numerical-only keys on mobile or tablet devices
            >> When you want to present a list of some sort to a user, you should use the appropriate list element (ol, <ul>, or <dl>) and their related list item elements
                >> This will not only let the user know when they are entering or exiting a list, but also how many items are in the list
            
        Headings and Landmarks: 
        >> Headings are the <h1> through <h6> elements, and like the name implies, these elements act as headings to sections of a page
        >> Landmarks, on the other hand, are HTML elements that act as regions of a page
        >> There are seven native HTML elements that define these landmark regions: 
            >> <aside>, <footer>, <form>, <header>, <main>, <nav>, <section>
        >> By properly using landmarks and headings, you provide users of assistive technologies a more operable and understandbale page: 
            >> not only can screen readers navigate a page via landmarks and headings by opening a menu in their screen reader, but these elements also have their roles announced to provide additional context
        >> If you were to use only <div> elements to act as these landmarks and headings, maybe adding in some CSS to visually style them
            >> then a screen reader user would have to go through the entire page just to get to a specific section, and they may not be able to actually tell what is a heading or a landmark on the page

    <!-- 
        ACCESSIBLE COLORS

        Introduction: 
        >> Although adding color to a page can make it more visually appealing, using the wrong color combination or relying solely on color to convey information can end up making things more difficult to perceive and understand for some users
        >> This doesn’t mean you have to limit yourself when choosing color schemes for a website, but it does mean you have to take extra care when actually using those colors
        
        >> color contrast: 
        >> A contrast ratio is the difference in brightness between two colors expressed as a ratio
        >> White text on a white background would have lowest ratio (1:1), while black text on a white background would have the highest (21:1)
        >> Contrast ratios refer to both normal text as well as images of text
        >> There are two different conformance levels for contrast ratios, both of which have rules for normal text and large text
        >> Normal text is defined as text with a font size that’s less than 18 points/24px (or less than 14 points/18.66px for bold text), 
        >> and large text is defined as text with a font size that is at least 18 points/24px (or at least 14 points/18.66px for bold text)
        >> Level AA (minimum): requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text
        >> Level AAA (enhanced): requires a contrast ration of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text
        >> Both conformance levels have exceptions that don’t need to follow the contrast ratio rules:
            >> Incidental text, such as text that just happens to be within an image that has other significant visual content, or text that is purely decorative
            >> Text that is part of an inactive or disabled user interface component, such as a button that is disabled and has a lowered opacity
            >> Text that is part of a logo or brand name
        >> You can also check the contrast ratio of the text within an element using your browser’s dev tools from color picker tools in browser

        >> Conveying Information: 
        >> you shouldn’t use color alone to convey information
        >> There may be exceptions where it’s necessary to only use color, but generally you want to follow this above mentioned rule
        >> Let’s say you want to create a form that has an instruction stating that required fields are indicated by red text
        >> If a user is color blind or otherwise has difficulty telling some colors apart, having to rely solely on the color of this text can make it difficult or even impossible to perceive or operate the form
        >> Instead of only using color, your form could indicate all required fields with red text and an asterisk
      -->

    <!-- 
        Keyboard navigation

        Focus: 
        >> An issue with using <div> and <span> elements is that, by default, they aren’t focusable and they don’t have any event handling by default
        >> In order to fix that non semantic we would need to take some extra steps, similar to the below code snippets:
       -->
    <!-- The `tabindex` attribute makes the `<div>` elements focusable. -->
    <div class='button-container'>
        <div class='rock button' tabindex='0'>Rock</div>
        <div class='paper button' tabindex='0'>Paper</div>
        <div class='scissors button' tabindex='0'>Scissors</div>
        <script>
            // We also need to manually add in event handling for both mouse and keyboard events.
            const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('.button');

            function nameAlerter(e) {
                if (e.type === 'click' || e.key === ' ' || e.key === 'Enter') {
                    alert(e.target.textContent);
                }
            }

            buttons.forEach(button => {
                button.addEventListener('click', nameAlerter)
                button.addEventListener('keydown', nameAlerter)
            })
        </script>
        <!-- 
            >> Of course, this example then makes it less understandable for screen reader users (remember, these “buttons” won’t provide any context)
            >> Not only does using the <button> element provide the context screen reader users need, but they’re focusable and have event handling for keyboards by default: pressing the “space” or “enter” keys on a keyboard when a <button> has focus will trigger the “click” event
            >> Using the correct semantic HTML can make this a lot easier of a goal to accomplish, but if you ever need to use an element that isn’t focusable or doesn’t have any event handling by default, then you need to add both of those functionalities in manually
         -->
    </div>
    <!-- 
        Focus Styles: 
        >> Another aspect of focusable elements is their focus styles, which are usually an outline or border surrounding the element when it receives focus
        >> You should never completely remove focus styles
        >> You should either leave these default focus styles alone, or you should replace them with your own focus styles
        >> Completely removing focus styles can make a page impossible for keyboard users to navigate and operate, as they have no visual indication what element actually has focus

        Tab Order: 
        >> tab order is the order in which elements on the page will receive focus when pressing the Tab key
        >> by default tab order is in the same order as the order of elements listed in the HTML file:
     -->
    <div class="tab-order">
        <!-- This element is first in the tab order. -->
        <div tabindex='0'>This is the first element listed in the HTML.</div>

        <!-- This element is second in the tab order. -->
        <div tabindex='0'>This is the second element listed in the HTML.</div>
        <!-- 
            >> Sometimes you may find it necessary to either change the visual order of elements on a page using CSS (the float or order properties, for example), or the tab order of elements themselves using the tabindex attribute
            >> Regardless of which method you may use, you should make sure the tab order matches the visual order of elements
            >> best way to avoid this issue of different tab-order is to just place elements in your HTMl file in the order that you want them to actually receive focus
         -->
    </div>

    <!-- 
        Hidden Content: 
        >> Sometimes you may want to hide some content until a specific event occurs, such as a user clicking on a button to open a menu or a modal box
        >> When you want to hide content for this sort of purpose, you need to make sure the content is not only visually hidden, but also hidden from assistive technologies until that content is meant to be visible
        >> If you don’t properly hide such content, then keyboard users would be able to tab into that content before they’re meant to, but in doing so they would lose track of any visual focus on the page
        >> These users would be left confused or even frustrated when they’re trying to tab through a page, only for their focus indicator to disappear into that hidden content
        >> One way to prevent this frustrating behavior is to give each individual item in that hidden content a tabindex value of -1
            >> since that prevents an element from receiving focus via the keyboard (though you can still give it focus with JavaScript’s focus() method)
        >> While this fixes the issue for keyboard users, other assistive technologies would still have access to and could still announce this hidden content
        >> A better solution is giving the container for the hidden content itself either the display: none or visibility: hidden CSS property when it’s hidden, and removing or overriding that property when it’s meant to be visible
            >> This not only removes the menu items from the tab order, but it also prevents assistive technologies from announcing them
     -->

    <!-- 
        Skip navigation

        Creating "Skip Navigation" Links: 
        >> idea is simple enough: provide a link at the top of the page that, when activated, jumps the user to the beginning of the main content area

        >> Visible skip links: 
        >> easiest method of creating a skip navigation link is to put it at or near the top of the page in regular text
        >> key is to make sure the link is one of the first items that screen readers hear and that keyboard users navigate to using the keyboard (typically by pressing the Tab key)
        >> Otherwise, users may not realize there is a skip navigation link there and may waste time navigating through extraneous links
        >> link must also be apparent to be helpful
      -->
    <div class="visible-links">
        <a href="#maincontent">Skip to main content</a>

            <main></main>
            <!-- 
            >> target is identified by its id attribute value matching the href value (minus the "#") of the skip link
            >> When the skip link is activated, keyboard focus will go to the <main> element
            >> Navigation and reading will proceed from this location in the page
         -->
    </div>

    <!-- 
        Temporarily hidden skip links: 
        >> Many designers worry about the aesthetic impact of visible skip navigation links
        >> They may think these links are unattractive or confusing to users who do not need them, so they may decide to make them invisible
        >> A very small or hidden link does not benefit the audience that most needs skip links—sighted keyboard users
        >> While screen readers have many mechanisms to jump around the page (e.g., headings and regions/landmarks), other keyboard users do not
        >> To address the concerns that a visible skip link can be intrusive, but still create a skip link that is useful for sighted keyboard users
            >> we recommend creating a link that is hidden until to the user navigates to it with a keyboard
        >> To be usable by all keyboard users, particularly sighted keyboard users, the link must: 
            >> be hidden by default
            >> be accessible to keyboard navigation
            >> become prominently visible when it is focused
            >> properly set focus to the main content area when activated
        >> Probably the most accessible method for visually hiding a skip link is to hide it off screen with CSS, then cause it to be positioned on screen when it receives keyboard focus
        >> Because the link is still part of the accessible content on the page, keyboard and screen reader users can navigate it, and the link will become visible when accessed
        >> Some techniques, such as hiding the skip link with CSS display:none or the hidden attribute, will remove the link from keyboard navigation making it inaccessible to all users
        >> Making the link the same color as the background or fully transparent, sizing the link to 0 pixels, or placing it on a one-pixel transparent image can also pose accessibility issues
            >> One potential issue with this approach is that if the user navigates very quickly using the Tab key, the link may be visible on the page for only a fraction of a second and may be overlooked
            >> This can be partially addressed by ensuring that the skip link is very visually distinctive at the top of the page when visible
            >> Additionally, one could use scripting or CSS transitions to cause the link to animate so it remains visible on screen for more time
        >> Navigate the links at the beginning of this page using the Tab key to see an example of a hidden skip link that becomes visible on keyboard focus using CSS transitions to make it visually distinctive and persistent on screen for at least a moment

        Which wording is best?
        >> There are multiple ways that the skip link could be worded:
            >> Skip navigation
            >> Skip main navigation
            >> Skip navigation links
            >> Skip to main content
            >> Skip to content

        Multiple skip links are usually unnecessary: 
        >> In most cases, a single skip link is sufficient
        >> For pages that have very few navigable items preceding the main content, a skip link may not be necessary at all
        >> On the other hand, a very complex page with several repeated elements may necessitate additional skip links
        >> Remember, the purpose of skip navigation links is to make keyboard navigation more efficient
        >> Adding more links increases link-clutter
        >> In-page links elsewhere in a page can also be used to allow users to jump to or jump over other types of page content
        >> "Article Contents" at the top of this page, for example, includes in-page links to facilitate navigation to major page sections
        >> A skip link could also be used to allow the user to quickly bypass confusing or potentially inaccessible content, such as ASCII art, complex tables, or complex social media feeds

        Other In-page Navigation Options: 
        >> WCAG conformance: 
        >> A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple Web pages
        >> This does not necessarily require that a skip link be present
            >> Beginning the main content with an <h1> or using a <main> region would be a sufficient "mechanism"
            >> However because neither of these techniques are highly useful for sighted keyboard users absent a screen reader or specialized software, a skip link is strongly recommended for optimal accessibility on pages with repeated navigation

        >> Headings and regions: 
        >> Implementing proper heading structures (especially starting the main content with an <h1>) and regions (especially <nav> and <main>) is a vital aspect of keyboard accessibility
        >> Unfortunately, browsers do not yet natively support this type of navigation without the use of extensions or a screen reader
        >> Even though skip navigation links are a rather clumsy and obtrusive solution to a real-world problem, they are still often necessary to best meet the needs of all keyboard users
        >> Within web pages and applications, focus management may be necessary to ensure that keyboard focus is set on content elements when they are presented or activated
        >> When a dialog pop-up appears, for example, focus will likely need to be set to it using JavaScript

        >> Alternate reading orders: 
        >> Some web sites use CSS to change page layouts so that the main content is presented before the navigation in the underlying source code (which is what determines the screen reader reading and keyboard navigation order), but it comes after the navigation visually
        >> Because the navigation is encountered first for keyboard and screen reader users, this method may make a skip navigation link unnecessary
        >> When the visual order does not align with the navigation and reading order, sighted keyboard or screen reader users may be confused when what they are seeing or navigating to seemingly jumps around the visual page
            >> these types of layouts are not recommended

        MEANINGFUL TEXT

        >> Meaningful text is pretty straight forward: when a user reads text or has it announced to them, they should be able to immediately understand what it means even without any surrounding context
        >> A lack of meaningful text can affect all users, but especially those who rely on assistive technologies

        Links: 
        >> To a sighted user, the link in Example 1 makes perfect sense
        >> However, in addition to being able to navigate a page via landmarks and headings (as mentioned in the Semantic HTML lesson), a screen reader may be able to navigate between each element of a specific type, such as links
        >> If a user were to navigate between all of the links on a page, the only thing that would get announced in Example 1 is, “Click here, link.”
        >> Without any surrounding context, the link is meaningless
        >> link in Example 2, however, not only makes sense in context for all users, but it also makes sense out of context for screen reader users when it gets announced: “The Odin Project, link.”
        >> When you add links to a page, there are a few rules you should be following: 
            >> Make sure that the text content of the <a> element somehow indicates where the link redirects to and that it’s brief (around 100 characters). So avoid using phrases like “click here” or “this page”
            >> If a link would open or download a file, include text that tells the user what kind of file it is as well as the file size
            >> If a link would automatically open in a new tab or window with the target="_blank" attribute, you should indicate this to the user in some way
        >> next time you need to use links, try saying the contents of the element out loud to yourself
        >> Does it reasonably indicate where that link would take you, such as the title of the page, article, or video?
        >> Are you aware whether it’ll open in a new tab automatically or not, or that it’ll open a download dialog?
        >> If you’ve been testing out using a screen reader up to this point, then an even better way to test whether a link has meaningful text is with the screen reader itself!

        >> What input is invalid? Why is it invalid? How can you fix it? None of these questions are answered
        >> Now imagine how meaningless this error must be to users of assistive technologies, who may not be able to see where an error is rendered on the page and may only have “invalid input” announced to them
        >> error in Example 2 clearly tells you what input is invalid, so you now know exactly where to go

        >> error in Example 3 is even more meaningful. It not only tells you what input is invalid, but also how to fix the error
        >> Generally when you inform a user of a form error, you should be informing them what input caused the error and, when possible, how to fix the error or why the error occurred in some way
        >> Another way to provide meaningful text in forms is with instructions, such as when a password input lists any characters that the password must contain (“Must include at least one uppercase letter and one number…”)
        >> For instructions that are unique to an input, they should be placed alongside the input itself
        >> Instructions that are more global across the form, such as indicating which inputs are required, should either be placed at the top of the form (“* indicates a required field”), or placed alongside the input or its label (“Name (required)”)
