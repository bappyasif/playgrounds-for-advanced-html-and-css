    <!-- 
        >> Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities and other circumstantial limitations can use them with as few barriers as possible
        >> Situational limitations are a little different
        >> Using a phone outside on a bright day, browsing a site with one hand while you’re busy doing something else with the other, or living in an area where the internet is slow or the bandwidth is expensive are all examples of situational limitations
        >> These limitations, unlike a disability, occur to users only in specific situations, but are still important to keep in mind when developing a website
        
        >> Why Web Accessibility Matters: 
        typo >> multi-story (multi storied)
        >> When you develop a website, you’re developing it for users, and you need that website to actually be usable by them (disablity, short term limitations diasblilty prone people)
        >> People with disabilities, older people with changing abilities, people who aren’t as tech savvy, and people with some sort of situational limitation are still users, and websites should be as equally usable by them as possible
        >> depending on the country, there could actually be laws requiring accessibility to be implemented

    <!-- 
        Diverse Abilities and Barriers: 

        >> Diversity of abilities: 
        >> There are many reasons why people may be experiencing varying degrees of auditory, cognitive, physical, speech, and visual disabilities
        >> there are many variations such as: 
            >> Age-related impairments, Multiple disabilities, Health conditions, Changing abilities, Temporary impairments, Situational limitations
        >> Websites and web tools designed for people with a broad range of abilities benefit everyone, including people without disabilities
        >> It is, therefore, important to consider the broad diversity of functional needs rather than to categorize people according to medical classifications

    <!-- 
        THE WEB CONTENT ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES (WCAG)
        >> WCAG exist in order to help create a shared standard when it comes to web accessibility
        >> Think of web accessibility as the destination, and the WCAG as one of the tools that can help get us closer to it
        >> It’s important to understand that while the WCAG can be incredibly helpful for building an a11y foundation, they are not the finish line when it comes to accessibility
        >> Like the name says, they are simply guidelines, and they will only help us make websites more accessible

        Four Principles: 
        >> WCAG are organized around four, core principles that should be kept in mind when implementing any sort of accessibility feature: 
            >> Perceivable: 
                >> Users must be able to perceive the information or user interfaces being presented
                typo >> For example, Light (light) text on a light background could be difficult for some users with a visual impairment to perceive
            >> Operable: 
                >> Users must be able to operate any user interfaces or navigation, and interfaces cannot require an interaction which the user cannot perform
                >> A navigation bar with drop-down menus that only expand when a mouse cursor hovers over them, for example, would not be operable by keyboard users giving those menu items focus
            >> Understandable: 
                >> Users must be able to understand any information or user interface that is presented to them
                >> For example, if a user tried submitting a form and received an error such as “Error 113: Bad data”, they wouldn’t be able to understand what the error actually means or how to fix whatever caused the error
            >> Robust: 
                >> Content must be accessible by current assistive technologies and other user agents, and must remain accessible as those technologies advance

        Conformance Levels: 
        >> WCAG has three different conformance levels, each of which is made up of various success criteria, or rules, that must be followed in order to successfully meet that level of conformance
            >> Level A: 
                >> essential support, is the minimum level of conformance for the WCAG
            >> Level AA: 
                >> ideal support, is the level many organizations strive for
                >> Meeting this level also requires meeting Level A
            >> Level AAA: 
                >> specialized support, isn’t recommended for entire sites to meet in full, as some content may make it impossible to meet this conformance level
                >> Meeting this level would require also meeting both Level A and Level AA

        typpo >> The goal of these lessons is (are) just to introduce you to some of the more common or simpler concepts that you should get into the habit of checking for moving forward
        (Before) Implementing Accessibility: 
        >> first thing to keep in mind is that no site will ever be 100% accessible
        >> second thing to keep in mind is that just taking those first few steps towards creating accessible websites matters just as much as the many more steps you’ll take in the future

        SEMANTIC HTML

        introduction: 
        >> As useful as <div> and <span> elements can be as generic containers, they’re not always the most a11y friendly elements to use
        >> While it may be tempting or easier to just use them for everything, from containers to interactive areas, you should not only check whether there is a more appropriate element to use in certain situations, but also whether you’re using an element correctly

        Importance of Semantics:
        >> In terms of web accessibility, using semantic HTML is important because it provides meaning and context
        >> Some elements have a semantic meaning, but don’t really provide any context when announced by assistive technologies, such as the <p> element
        >> Then there are elements that have a semantic meaning and are announced with some sort of context to help users perceive or operate them, like a <button>
        >> <div> and <span> elements, most likely two of the more common elements you use, are semantically neutral
            >> That is, they themselves have no semantic meaning and provide no context on their own to assistive technologies, which can make it more difficult for users of such technologies to perceive, operate, and understand them
            >> Don’t let this lack of semantics and context make you feel like you can never use a <div> or <span> ever again, though
            >> They still have their uses as generic containers, such as for layouts or for generic text
        >> consider this given snippet: 
            <-- These are buttons... right? ->
            <div class='button-container'>
                <div class='rock'>Rock</div>
                <div class='paper'>Paper</div>
                <div class='scissors'>Scissors</div>
            </div>
            >> A sighted user would most likely have no trouble playing the game if the elements looked like something to interact with
            >> A screen reader user, however, would have no idea what any of these elements mean
            >> screen reader would announce the text contents of the element (“Rock”, “Paper”, or “Scissors”), and the user might think it’s just plain text on the page and move on
            >> There’s no context to tell the user that they’re supposed to, or that they even can, interact with these elements
            >> This issue can be easily fixed by using semantic HTML: 
                <-- Okay, these are *definitely* buttons ->
                <div class='button-container'>
                    <button class='rock'>Rock</button>
                    <button class='paper'>Paper</button>
                    <button class='scissors'>Scissors</button>
                </div>
            >> Because the <button> element has a semantic meaning and provides context, a screen reader would announce the text content as well as the role of the element: “Rock, button”

        Using Semantic HTML Correctly: 
        >> When it comes to using semantic HTML correctly, you want to think about what your intent for users is and what context you want (or need) to provide to them
        >> This can vary depending on the situation, but there are some things you should absolutely be checking for moving forward: 
            >> If a user is meant to click something, whether it’s an actual button or not, you will usually want to use a <button> element
                >> This will let the user know that they can interact with the element by clicking on it
            >> If you want to provide some sort of tabular data to a user, use a <table> element along with the elements related to it
                >> This will allow a user to more easily navigate and understand the data being presented
            >> When you use an input element, you should always create a relationship between it and a <label> element
                >> A <label> provides context for what an input actually means to assistive technologies, announcing the label contents each time the input is announced
                >> Not only that, but a proper <label> increases the clickable area of the input itself, which is useful for users who have trouble clicking on smaller items
                >> There are two ways you can create this relationship: 
                    <-- Useful when you need the input itself to have an ID ->
                    <label for='name'>Name</label>
                    <input type='text' id='name' />

                    <-- Look, Ma, no ID! ->
                    <label>
                    Name
                    <input type='text' />
                    </label>
            >> you should always use the type for "input" that makes the most sense for its intended use
                >> type="text"makes more sense for a name or address field, while type="email" or type="tel" would of course make more sense for an e-mail or telephone field, respectively
                >> For certain devices, using the correct type may show only the required or additional characters on the keyboard
                >> A type="tel" input, for example, might make it much easier for users to fill out their phone number by providing larger, numerical-only keys on mobile or tablet devices
            >> When you want to present a list of some sort to a user, you should use the appropriate list element (ol, <ul>, or <dl>) and their related list item elements
                >> This will not only let the user know when they are entering or exiting a list, but also how many items are in the list
            
        Headings and Landmarks: 
        >> Headings are the <h1> through <h6> elements, and like the name implies, these elements act as headings to sections of a page
        >> Landmarks, on the other hand, are HTML elements that act as regions of a page
        >> There are seven native HTML elements that define these landmark regions: 
            >> <aside>, <footer>, <form>, <header>, <main>, <nav>, <section>
        >> By properly using landmarks and headings, you provide users of assistive technologies a more operable and understandbale page: 
            >> not only can screen readers navigate a page via landmarks and headings by opening a menu in their screen reader, but these elements also have their roles announced to provide additional context
        >> If you were to use only <div> elements to act as these landmarks and headings, maybe adding in some CSS to visually style them
            >> then a screen reader user would have to go through the entire page just to get to a specific section, and they may not be able to actually tell what is a heading or a landmark on the page

        ACCESSIBLE COLORS

        Introduction: 
        >> Although adding color to a page can make it more visually appealing, using the wrong color combination or relying solely on color to convey information can end up making things more difficult to perceive and understand for some users
        >> This doesn’t mean you have to limit yourself when choosing color schemes for a website, but it does mean you have to take extra care when actually using those colors
        
        >> color contrast: 
        >> A contrast ratio is the difference in brightness between two colors expressed as a ratio
        >> White text on a white background would have lowest ratio (1:1), while black text on a white background would have the highest (21:1)
        >> Contrast ratios refer to both normal text as well as images of text
        >> There are two different conformance levels for contrast ratios, both of which have rules for normal text and large text
        >> Normal text is defined as text with a font size that’s less than 18 points/24px (or less than 14 points/18.66px for bold text), 
        >> and large text is defined as text with a font size that is at least 18 points/24px (or at least 14 points/18.66px for bold text)
        >> Level AA (minimum): requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text
        >> Level AAA (enhanced): requires a contrast ration of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text
        >> Both conformance levels have exceptions that don’t need to follow the contrast ratio rules:
            >> Incidental text, such as text that just happens to be within an image that has other significant visual content, or text that is purely decorative
            >> Text that is part of an inactive or disabled user interface component, such as a button that is disabled and has a lowered opacity
            >> Text that is part of a logo or brand name
        >> You can also check the contrast ratio of the text within an element using your browser’s dev tools from color picker tools in browser

        >> Conveying Information: 
        >> you shouldn’t use color alone to convey information
        >> There may be exceptions where it’s necessary to only use color, but generally you want to follow this above mentioned rule
        >> Let’s say you want to create a form that has an instruction stating that required fields are indicated by red text
        >> If a user is color blind or otherwise has difficulty telling some colors apart, having to rely solely on the color of this text can make it difficult or even impossible to perceive or operate the form
        >> Instead of only using color, your form could indicate all required fields with red text and an asterisk
