    <!-- 
        >> Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities and other circumstantial limitations can use them with as few barriers as possible
        >> Situational limitations are a little different
        >> Using a phone outside on a bright day, browsing a site with one hand while you’re busy doing something else with the other, or living in an area where the internet is slow or the bandwidth is expensive are all examples of situational limitations
        >> These limitations, unlike a disability, occur to users only in specific situations, but are still important to keep in mind when developing a website
        
        >> Why Web Accessibility Matters: 
        typo >> multi-story (multi storied)
        >> When you develop a website, you’re developing it for users, and you need that website to actually be usable by them (disablity, short term limitations diasblilty prone people)
        >> People with disabilities, older people with changing abilities, people who aren’t as tech savvy, and people with some sort of situational limitation are still users, and websites should be as equally usable by them as possible
        >> depending on the country, there could actually be laws requiring accessibility to be implemented

        Diverse Abilities and Barriers: 

        >> Diversity of abilities: 
        >> There are many reasons why people may be experiencing varying degrees of auditory, cognitive, physical, speech, and visual disabilities
        >> there are many variations such as: 
            >> Age-related impairments, Multiple disabilities, Health conditions, Changing abilities, Temporary impairments, Situational limitations
        >> Websites and web tools designed for people with a broad range of abilities benefit everyone, including people without disabilities
        >> It is, therefore, important to consider the broad diversity of functional needs rather than to categorize people according to medical classifications

        THE WEB CONTENT ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES (WCAG)
        >> WCAG exist in order to help create a shared standard when it comes to web accessibility
        >> Think of web accessibility as the destination, and the WCAG as one of the tools that can help get us closer to it
        >> It’s important to understand that while the WCAG can be incredibly helpful for building an a11y foundation, they are not the finish line when it comes to accessibility
        >> Like the name says, they are simply guidelines, and they will only help us make websites more accessible

        Four Principles: 
        >> WCAG are organized around four, core principles that should be kept in mind when implementing any sort of accessibility feature: 
            >> Perceivable: 
                >> Users must be able to perceive the information or user interfaces being presented
                typo >> For example, Light (light) text on a light background could be difficult for some users with a visual impairment to perceive
            >> Operable: 
                >> Users must be able to operate any user interfaces or navigation, and interfaces cannot require an interaction which the user cannot perform
                >> A navigation bar with drop-down menus that only expand when a mouse cursor hovers over them, for example, would not be operable by keyboard users giving those menu items focus
            >> Understandable: 
                >> Users must be able to understand any information or user interface that is presented to them
                >> For example, if a user tried submitting a form and received an error such as “Error 113: Bad data”, they wouldn’t be able to understand what the error actually means or how to fix whatever caused the error
            >> Robust: 
                >> Content must be accessible by current assistive technologies and other user agents, and must remain accessible as those technologies advance

        Conformance Levels: 
        >> WCAG has three different conformance levels, each of which is made up of various success criteria, or rules, that must be followed in order to successfully meet that level of conformance
            >> Level A: 
                >> essential support, is the minimum level of conformance for the WCAG
            >> Level AA: 
                >> ideal support, is the level many organizations strive for
                >> Meeting this level also requires meeting Level A
            >> Level AAA: 
                >> specialized support, isn’t recommended for entire sites to meet in full, as some content may make it impossible to meet this conformance level
                >> Meeting this level would require also meeting both Level A and Level AA

        typpo >> The goal of these lessons is (are) just to introduce you to some of the more common or simpler concepts that you should get into the habit of checking for moving forward
        (Before) Implementing Accessibility: 
        >> first thing to keep in mind is that no site will ever be 100% accessible
        >> second thing to keep in mind is that just taking those first few steps towards creating accessible websites matters just as much as the many more steps you’ll take in the future
