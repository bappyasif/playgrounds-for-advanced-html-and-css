    <!-- 
        >> transform property is a powerful tool to change the appearance of elements without affecting the natural document flow
        >> Transforms are very commonly used for animated effects
        
        Basics of Transforms:
        typo >> transform property takes in one or more CSS transform functions as its values, with those functions taking in their own value(s), usually an angle or a number
        >> Almost all elements can have the transform property applied to it, with the exceptions being <col>, <colgroup>, and non-replaced inline elements
            >> “Non-replaced” simply refers to elements whose content is contained within the HTML document (<span>, <b>, and <em>, for example), as opposed to a “replaced” element’s content being contained outside of the document (<a>, <iframe>, and <img>, for example)
        
        Two-Dimensional Transforms:
        >> we’ll go through 2D transforms with the following transform functions: rotate, scale, skew, and translate
            >> Rotate: 
            >> This is the transform function value to rotate an element on a 2D plane: .element { transform: rotate(45deg || -1rad || 0.3turn); }
            
            >> Scale: 
            >> These are the transform function values to scale an element on a 2D plane: 
                >>  .element {
                        transform: scaleX(0.25);
                        transform: scaleY(1.5);
                        transform: scale(0.25, 1.5);
                        transform: scale(0.5);
                    }
            
            >> Skew: 
            >> These are the transform function values to skew an element on a 2D plane:
                >> .element {
                        transform: skewX(45deg);
                        transform: skewY(-0.5rad);
                        transform: skew(45deg, -0.5rad);
                        /* single value behaves the same as skewX */
                        transform: skew(45deg);
                    }
            
            >> Translate: 
            >> These are the transform function values to translate an element on a 2D plane:
                >> .element {
                        transform: translateX(20px);
                        /* percent values are of the element's width */
                        transform: translateY(-33%);
                        transform: translate(20px, -33%);
                    }
                
            
        Chaining Multiple Transforms: 
        >> Chaining multiple transforms is as simple as adding more transform functions with a space between each one    
        >> transform functions are multiplied in order from left to right, meaning that composite transforms are effectively applied in order from right to left
        >> While you can generally chain multiple transforms in any order for various results, there is one exception: perspective
        >>

    <div class="chaining-transforms">
        <style>
            .red-box,
            .blue-box {
                position: absolute;
                width: 100px;
                height: 100px;
            }

            .red-box {
                background: red;
                transform: rotate(45deg) translate(200%);
            }

            .blue-box {
                background: blue;
                transform: translate(200%) rotate(45deg);
            }
        </style>
        <div class="red-box"></div>
        <div class="blue-box"></div>

        Three-Dimensional Transforms: 
        >> rotate, scale, and translate transform functions aren’t limited to just the 2D plane
        >> They work for the 3D plane as well! However, to perceive a 3D effect on some of these function values, perspective is required

        >> Perspective: 
        >> This is the transform function value to set the distance from the user to the z = 0 plane: .element { transform: perspective(); }
        >> Essentially, by setting a perspective value, we are telling the object to render as if we were viewing it from a specific distance on the z-axis
        >> Unlike other transform function values, perspective must be declared first (leftmost) when there are multiple transform function values
