    <!-- 
        >> transform property is a powerful tool to change the appearance of elements without affecting the natural document flow
        >> Transforms are very commonly used for animated effects
        
        Basics of Transforms:
        typo >> transform property takes in one or more CSS transform functions as its values, with those functions taking in their own value(s), usually an angle or a number
        >> Almost all elements can have the transform property applied to it, with the exceptions being <col>, <colgroup>, and non-replaced inline elements
            >> “Non-replaced” simply refers to elements whose content is contained within the HTML document (<span>, <b>, and <em>, for example), as opposed to a “replaced” element’s content being contained outside of the document (<a>, <iframe>, and <img>, for example)
        
        Two-Dimensional Transforms:
        >> we’ll go through 2D transforms with the following transform functions: rotate, scale, skew, and translate
            >> Rotate: 
            >> This is the transform function value to rotate an element on a 2D plane: .element { transform: rotate(45deg || -1rad || 0.3turn); }
            
            >> Scale: 
            >> These are the transform function values to scale an element on a 2D plane: 
                >>  .element {
                        transform: scaleX(0.25);
                        transform: scaleY(1.5);
                        transform: scale(0.25, 1.5);
                        transform: scale(0.5);
                    }
            
            >> Skew: 
            >> These are the transform function values to skew an element on a 2D plane:
                >> .element {
                        transform: skewX(45deg);
                        transform: skewY(-0.5rad);
                        transform: skew(45deg, -0.5rad);
                        /* single value behaves the same as skewX */
                        transform: skew(45deg);
                    }
            
            >> Translate: 
            >> These are the transform function values to translate an element on a 2D plane:
                >> .element {
                        transform: translateX(20px);
                        /* percent values are of the element's width */
                        transform: translateY(-33%);
                        transform: translate(20px, -33%);
                    }
                
            
        Chaining Multiple Transforms: 
        >> Chaining multiple transforms is as simple as adding more transform functions with a space between each one    
        >> transform functions are multiplied in order from left to right, meaning that composite transforms are effectively applied in order from right to left
        >> While you can generally chain multiple transforms in any order for various results, there is one exception: perspective
        >>

                background: blue;

        Three-Dimensional Transforms: 
        >> rotate, scale, and translate transform functions aren’t limited to just the 2D plane
        >> They work for the 3D plane as well! However, to perceive a 3D effect on some of these function values, perspective is required

        >> Perspective: 
        >> This is the transform function value to set the distance from the user to the z = 0 plane: .element { transform: perspective(); }
        >> Essentially, by setting a perspective value, we are telling the object to render as if we were viewing it from a specific distance on the z-axis
        >> Unlike other transform function values, perspective must be declared first (leftmost) when there are multiple transform function values
        
        >> Rotate:
        >> These are the additional transform function values to rotate an element on a 3D plane:
            >> e.g. .element {
                        transform: rotateX(60deg);
                        transform: rotateY(60deg);
                        transform: rotateZ(60deg);
                        transform: rotate3d();
                    }

        >> scale: 
        >> These are the additional transform function values to scale an element on a 3D plane:
        >> e.g. .element {
                    transform: scaleZ();
                    transform: scale3d();
                }
            
        >> Translate: 
        >> These are the additional transform function values to translate an element on a 3D plane:
        >> e.g. .element {
                    transform: translateZ();
                    transform: translate3d();
                }
        >> translateZ doesn’t do much without perspective
        >> Instead, perspective and translateZ work together to create the illusion of 3-dimensional distance from the rendered object, as shown in the example below

        <style>
            .translate30 {
                transform: perspective(100px) translateZ(30px);
            }

            .translate-100 {
                transform: perspective(100px) translateZ(-100px);

        matrix:
        >> Matrix is a way of combining all transform functions into one
        >> It is seldom used due to its poor readability, and almost never written by hand
        >> Unless you have a very complex transformation to apply, you should use other transform function values instead
        >> These are the transform function values for it: 
        >> e.g. .element {
                    transform: matrix();
                    transform: matrix3d();
                }
        >> How does matrix() Work?
        >> Any time you do a CSS transform, you're affecting the matrix, Even if you use another function such as rotate(), you're still affecting the matrix
        >> matrix() function accepts six arguments that determine how the element will be transformed: matrix(a, b, c, d, e, f)
            >> Here's what they're for: 
            >> a, d: arguments a and d represent how the element is scaled in the x and y direction respectively (just like in scale(a, d))
            >> b, c: arguments b and c represent how the element is skewed (just like in skew(b, c))
            >> e, f: arguments e and f represent how the element is translated in the x and y direction respectively (just like in translate(e, f))
        >> Both lines have the same result
            scale(2, 3);
            matrix(2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0);
        >> These make the element appear twice as long in the X axis, and three times as long in the Y axis
        >> matrix() function only deals with 2D transforms, for 3d use matrix3d(), and this function accepts 16 parameters for defining a transform in three-dimensional space
        >> matrix() function is an alternative to the two-dimensional transform functions rotate(), skew(), scale(), and translate()

        Benefits of Transforms:
        >> In order to understand why the transform property is great, you have to be aware of CSS triggers
