    <title>Using media queries</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- 
        >> Media queries are useful when you want to modify your site or app depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or browser viewport width)
        >> Media queries are used for the following: 
            >> To conditionally apply styles with the CSS @media and @import at-rules
            >> To target specific media for the <style>, <link>, <source>, and other HTML elements with the media= attribute
            >> To test and monitor media states using the Window.matchMedia() and MediaQueryList.addListener() JavaScript methods
            
        Syntax: 
        >> A media query is composed of an optional media type and any number of media feature expressions, which may optionally be combined in various ways using logical operators
        >> Media queries are case-insensitive
            >> Media types define the broad category of device for which the media query applies: all, print, screen
                >> type is optional (assumed to be all) except when using the not or only logical operators
            >> Media features describe a specific characteristic of the user agent, output device, or environment: any-hover, any-pointer, aspect-ratio, color, color-gamut, color-index, device-aspect-ratio Deprecated, device-height Deprecated, device-width Deprecated, display-mode, dynamic-range, forced-colors, grid, height, hover, inverted-colors, monochrome, orientation, overflow-block, overflow-inline, pointer, prefers-color-scheme, prefers-contrast, prefers-reduced-motion, resolution, scripting, update, video-dynamic-range, width
                >> For example, the hover feature allows a query to test against whether the device supports hovering over elements
                >> Media feature expressions test for their presence or value, and are entirely optional
                >> Each media feature expression must be surrounded by parentheses
            >> Logical operators can be used to compose a complex media query: not, and, and only
                >> You can also combine multiple media queries into a single rule by separating them with commas
        >> A media query computes to true when the media type (if specified) matches the device on which a document is being displayed and all media feature expressions compute as true
        >> Queries involving unknown media types are always false
        >> A style sheet with a media query attached to its <link> tag will still download even if the query returns false, the download will happen but the priority of downloading will be much lower
        >> Nevertheless, its contents will not apply unless and until the result of the query changes to true


        Targeting media types: 
        >> Media types describe the general category of a given device
        >> Although websites are commonly designed with screens in mind, you may want to create styles that target special devices such as printers or audio-based screenreaders
        >> for example this css targets printers: @media print { .... }
        >> You can also target multiple devices: For instance, this @media rule uses two media queries to target both screen and print devices: @media screen, print { .... }
        >> to target more specific attributes, use media features instead

        
        Targeting media features: 
        >> Media features describe the specific characteristics of a given user agent, output device, or environment
        >> For instance, you can apply specific styles to widescreen monitors, computers that use mice, or to devices that are being used in low-light conditions
            >> This example applies styles when the user's primary input mechanism (such as a mouse) can hover over elements: @media (hover: hover) { .... }
        >> Many media features are range features, which means they can be prefixed with "min-" or "max-" to express "minimum condition" or "maximum condition" constraints
            >> For example, this CSS will apply styles only if your browser's viewport width is equal to or narrower than 12450px: @media (max-width: 12450px) { .... }
        >> If you create a media feature query without specifying a value, the nested styles will be used as long as the feature's value is not zero
            >> For example, this CSS will apply to any device with a color screen: @media (color) { .... }
        >> If a feature doesn't apply to the device on which the browser is running, expressions involving that media feature are always false


        Creating complex media queries: 
        >> Sometimes you may want to create a media query that depends on multiple conditions
        >> This is where the logical operators come in: not, and, and only
        >> Furthermore, you can combine multiple media queries into a comma-separated list; this allows you to apply the same styles in different situations
        >> and operator can also combine multiple media features into a single media query
        >> not operator, meanwhile, negates a media query, basically reversing its normal meaning
        >> only operator prevents older browsers from applying the styles
        >> In most cases, the all media type is used by default when no other type is specified
        >> However, if you use the not or only operators, you must explicitly specify a media type

        >> Combining multiple types or features: 
        >> and keyword combines a media feature with a media type or other media features
        >> This example combines two media features to restrict styles to landscape-oriented devices with a width of at least 30 ems: @media (min-width: 30em) and (orientation: landscape) { .... }
        >> To limit the styles to devices with a screen, you can chain the media features to the screen media type: @media screen and (min-width: 30em) and (orientation: landscape) { ... }       

        >> Testing for multiple queries: 
        >> You can use a comma-separated list to apply styles when the user's device matches any one of various media types, features, or states
        >> For instance, the following rule will apply its styles if the user's device has either a minimum height of 680px or is a screen device in portrait mode: @media (min-height: 680px), screen and (orientation: portrait) { .... }
        >> Taking the above example, if the user had a printer with a page height of 800px, the media statement would return true because the first query would apply
        >> Likewise, if the user were on a smartphone in portrait mode with a viewport height of 480px, the second query would apply and the media statement would still return true

        >> Inverting a query's meaning: 
        >> not keyword inverts the meaning of an entire media query
        >> It will only negate the specific media query it is applied to
        >> Thus, it will not apply to every media query in a comma-separated list of media queries
        >> not keyword can't be used to negate an individual feature query, only an entire media query
        >> not is evaluated last in the following query: @media not all and (monochrome) { .... }
        >> As another example, the following media query: @media not screen and (color), print and (color) { .... }

        >> Improving compatibility with older browsers: 
        >> only keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media queries with media features from applying the given styles
        >> It has no effect on modern browsers: @media only screen and (color) { ... }


        Syntax improvements in Level 4: 
        >> Media Queries Level 4 specification includes some syntax improvements to make media queries using features that have a "range" type, for example width or height, less verbose
        >> Level 4 adds a range context for writing such queries
        >> For example, using the max- functionality for width we might write the following: @media (max-width: 30em) { .... }
            >> In Media Queries Level 4 this can be written as: @media (width <= 30em) { .... }
        >> Using min- and max- we might test for a width between two values like so: @media (min-width: 30em) and (max-width: 50em) { ... }
            >> This would convert to the Level 4 syntax as: @media (30em <= width <= 50em ) { .... }
        >> Media Queries Level 4 also adds ways to combine media queries using full boolean algebra with and, not, and or

        >> Negating a feature with not: 
        >> Using not() around a media feature negates that feature in the query
        >> For example, not(hover) would match if the device had no hover capability: @media (not(hover)) { .... }

        >> Testing for multiple features with or: 
        >> You can use or to test for a match among more than one feature, resolving to true if any of the features are true
        >> For example, the following query tests for devices that have a monochrome display or hover capability: @media (not (color)) or (hover) { .... }

        Media Query CSS Tutorial -- Standard Resolutions, CSS Breakpoints, and Target Phone Sizes

        >> A Media query is a CSS3 feature that makes a webpage adapt its layout to different screen sizes and media types

        Syntax: 
        >> @media media type and (condition: breakpoint) { // CSS rules }
            >> We can target different media types under a variety of conditions
            >> If the condition and/or media types meet, then the rules inside the media query will be applied, otherwise, they won’t
        
        @ Media Rule: 
        >> We start defining media queries with @media rule and later include CSS rules inside the curly braces
        >> @ media rule is also used to specify target media types:  @media () { // CSS rules }

        Parenthesis: 
        >> Inside the parenthesis, we set a condition
        >> For example, I want to apply a larger font size for mobile devices
        >> To do that, we need to set a maximum width which checks the width of a device: 
        >> .text {
                font-size: 14px;
            }

            @media (max-width: 480px) {
                .text {
                    font-size: 16px;
                }
            }
        >> Normally, the text size will be 14px
        >> However since we applied a media query, it will change to 16px when a device has a maximum width of 480px or less
        >> Always put your media queries at the end of your CSS file

        Media Types: 
        >> If we don’t apply a media type, the @ media rule selects all types of devices by default
        >> Otherwise, Media types come right after the @ media rule
        >> There are many kinds of devices but we can group them into 4 categories: 
            >> all — for all media types
            >> print — for printers
            >> screen — for computer screens, tablets and, smart-phones
            >> speech — for screen readers that “read” the page out loud
        >> For example, when I want to select only screens, I will set the screen keyword right after the @ media rule. I also must concatenate the rules with the “and” keyword: 
        >> @media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
                .text {
                    font-size: 16px;
                }
            }

        >> Breakpoints: 
        >> A breakpoint is a key to determine when to change the layout and adapt the new rules inside the media queries
        >> from above example, breakpoint is 480px
            >> Basically, if the width of a device is smaller than 480px, the text class will be applied, otherwise, it won’t
        
        >> Common Breakpoints: Is there a Standard Resolution? 
        >> There are a ton of devices on the market so we can’t and we shouldn’t define fixed breakpoints for each of them
        >> That’s why we can’t say that there is a standard resolution for devices, but there are some commonly used breakpoints in daily programming
        >> some common breakpoints for widths of devices: 
            >> 320px — 480px: Mobile devices
            >> 481px — 768px: iPads, Tablets
            >> 769px — 1024px: Small screens, laptops
            >> 1025px — 1200px: Desktops, large screens
            >> 1201px and more —  Extra large screens, TV
