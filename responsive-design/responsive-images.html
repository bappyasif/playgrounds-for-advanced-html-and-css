    <!-- 
        >> Images require a little special care on responsive websites

        Baiscs: 
        >> most basic problem that you are going to face when working with responsive images is the aspect-ratio, or the relationship between width and height
        >> If you shrink the width of an image on smaller screens, and do not also manipulate the height the image will appear distorted!

        >> solution to this issue is incredibly easy, and we’ve already mentioned it in an earlier lesson: simply don’t define both a width and a height
        >> If an image is given a flexible width, and the height is set to auto, then it should retain it’s aspect ratio correctly

        background-size, background-position and object-fit: 
        >> What if you don’t want your image to simply shrink (in both height and width)?
            >> background-size and object-fit are two properties that can provide a little more flexibility (pun intended) with how aspect-ratios are handled
            >> background-position and background-size are properties that work on elements with a background image, and do not work on normal img tags
                >> you can get quite a lot of control over the display and placement of background images by working with these properties
            >> For example, background-position: center will make sure the image is always centered in it’s container, even if the container is too small to fit the whole image
            >> background-size: cover will resize the image so that it is always completely filling it’s container while cropping as little as possible

        background-size, background-position and object-fit: contiued: 
        >> object-fit works similarly, but is meant for img tags
        >> With the object-fit property you can specify a width and height for your images and then tell an image how it is supposed to fit itself to those dimensions
        >> default value for object-fit is fill, which simply stretches the image to fit the dimensions, but much like background-size you can also tell it to cover or contain the image
     -->
    <div class="object-fit">
        <style>
            .object-fit > img {
                /* height: 300px; */
                width: 100%;
                object-fit: cover;

    <!-- 
        Even More Control!: 
        >> It is also possible to literally use different images for different screen sizes
        >> This gives you the most control over exactly how your images are displayed at various resolutions
            >> For example, instead of just trusting object-fit to keep the subject of a photograph in frame, you could present a cropped version of it on smaller screens
            >> There are two ways of achieving this, but the most flexible is using the <picture> tag
