    <!-- 
        >> first step to making responsive websites is using techniques that are naturally flexible
        >> in most cases, it’s preferable to rely on tools like flexbox and grid to make your pages work on a wide range of screens first
        >> Plain HTML, with no CSS is responsive
        >> it is important to keep in mind that most of the elements you’re using to build your project are responsive until you change that with CSS
        >> If you approach your project with this mindset and do your best to maintain that natural responsiveness, you might find that there isn’t that much extra you need to do to make your sites properly responsive

        Avoid Fixed Width and Height: 
        >> number one enemy of flexibility is a fixed width on an element
        >> If you put width: 600px on anything, then it will never be able to shrink below that width, which ruins your chances of getting that thing to fit on most phone screens
        >> Likewise, sticking a fixed height on an element can cause issues if the contents of that element run out of room
        >> Obviously the context will determine what works in a given situation, but an easy fix in many cases is replacing width or height with max-width or min-height (min-width and max-height are also valid and may be useful depending on the context)

     -->
    <div class="width-example">
        <!-- When a max-width is defined, the element will not exceed that width, but will shrink if the screen is too small to accommodate it -->
        <style>
            .width-example>.box {
                background: sandybrown;
                border: 8px solid saddlebrown;
                margin: 0 auto;
                padding: 32px;
                font-size: 32px;

                /* width: 600px; */
                max-width: 600px;

        <!-- 
            >> This example demonstrates the problem with static heights
            >> On a full-sized screen the text would fit inside the pink box just fine, but here on this cramped embed, it overflows!
            >> In this case changing height: 300px to min-height: 300px will fix the issue
         -->
    </div>

    <!-- 
        Avoid heights all together: 
        >> In most cases, you should avoid setting a height altogether
        >> There are some exceptions to this rule (headers and footers perhaps) but you should prefer using margin and padding to increase space around your content
        >> Using margin and padding will keep your elements flexible no matter what the content inside does

        When fixed widths are appropriate: 
        >> It’s hard to make a universal rule, but in general the smaller your widths the more likely it’s fine to make them fixed
        >> For example, a 32px icon on your page isn’t going to benefit from using max-width because you probably don’t want it to shrink
        >> Likewise a 250px sidebar probably needs to always be 250px
        >> As with anything you just need to consider your options and pick what seems to be the most appropriate

        Use Flex and Grid: 
        >> Simply using flex and grid don’t necessarily guarantee perfect responsiveness, but they are really helpful tools
        >> things like flex-wrap and grid’s minmax, auto-fill and similar properties can make some impressively responsive layouts without much extra work

        Viewport meta tag

        Background: 
        >> browser's viewport is the area of the window in which web content can be seen
        >> This is often not the same size as the rendered page, in which case the browser provides scrollbars for the user to scroll around and access all the content
        >> Some mobile devices and other narrow screens render pages in a virtual window or viewport, which is usually wider than the screen, and then shrink the rendered result down so it can all be seen at once
        >> Users can then pan and zoom to see different areas of the page
        >> For example, if a mobile screen has a width of 640px, pages might be rendered with a virtual viewport of 980px, and then it will be shrunk down to fit into the 640px space
        >> This is done because not all pages are optimized for mobile and break (or at least look bad) when rendered at a small viewport width
        >> This virtual viewport is a way to make non-mobile-optimized sites in general look better on narrow screen devices
        >> However, this mechanism is not so good for pages that are optimized for narrow screens using media queries — if the virtual viewport is 980px for example, media queries that kick in at 640px or 480px or less will never be used, limiting the effectiveness of such responsive design techniques
        >> viewport meta tag mitigates this problem of virtual viewport on narrow screen devices
        typo >> ## Viewport basics (next line)

        >> Viewport basics: 
        >> A typical mobile-optimized site contains something like the following: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        >> Not all devices are the same width; you should make sure that your pages work well in a large variation of screen sizes and orientations
        >> basic properties of the "viewport" <meta> tag include: 
            >> width: 
                >> Controls the size of the viewport
                >> It can be set to a specific number of pixels like width=600 or to the special value device-width, which is 100vw, or 100% of the viewport width
                >> Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored
            >> height: 
                >> Controls the size of the viewport
                >> It can be set to a specific number of pixels like height=400 or to the special value device-height, which is 100vh, or 100% of the viewport height
                >> Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored
            >> initial-scale: 
                >> Controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded
                >> Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default:1. Negative values: ignored
            >> minimum-scale: 
                >> Controls how much zoom out is allowed on the page
                >> Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 0.1. Negative values: ignored
            >> maximum-scale: 
                >> Controls how much zoom in is allowed on the page
                >> Any value less than 3 fails accessibility
                >> Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default:10. Negative values: ignored
            >> user-scalable: 
                >> Controls whether zoom in and zoom out actions are allowed on the page
                >> Valid values: 0, 1, yes, or no
                >> Default: 1, which is the same as yes
                >> Setting the value to 0, which is the same as no, is against Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
                >> WCAG requires a minimum of 2x scaling; however, the best practice is to enable a 5x zoom
        
        Screen density: 
        >> Screen resolutions have risen to the size that individual pixels are indistinguishable by the humans
        >> For example, smartphones often have small screens with resolutions upwards of 1920—1080 pixels (~400 dpi)
        >> Because of this, many browsers can display their pages in a smaller physical size by translating multiple hardware pixels for each CSS "pixel"
        >> On high dpi screens, pages with initial-scale=1 will effectively be zoomed by browsers
        >> Their text will be smooth and crisp, but their bitmap images may not take advantage of the full screen resolution
        >> To get sharper images on these screens, web developers may want to design images – or whole layouts – at a higher scale than their final size and then scale them down using CSS or viewport properties
        >> default pixel ratio depends on the display density
        >> On a display with density less than 200dpi, the ratio is 1.0
        >> On displays with density between 200 and 300dpi, the ratio is 1.5
        >> For displays with density over 300dpi, the ratio is the integer floor(density/150dpi)
        >> Note that the default ratio is true only when the viewport scale equals 1, Otherwise, the relationship between CSS pixels and device pixels depends on the current zoom level


        Viewport width and screen width: 
        >> Sites can set their viewport to a specific size
        >> For example, the definition "width=320, initial-scale=1" can be used to fit precisely onto a small phone display in portrait mode
        >> This can cause problems when the browser doesn't render a page at a larger size
        >> To fix this, browsers will expand the viewport width if necessary to fill the screen at the requested scale
        >> This is especially useful on large-screen devices
        >> For pages that set an initial or maximum scale, this means the width property actually translates into a minimum viewport width
        >> For example, if your layout needs at least 500 pixels of width then you can use the following markup
        >> When the screen is more than 500 pixels wide, the browser will expand the viewport (rather than zoom in) to fit the screen: 
            >> <meta name="viewport" content="width=500, initial-scale=1">
        >> Other attributes that are available are minimum-scale, maximum-scale, and user-scalable
        >> These properties affect the initial scale and width, as well as limiting changes in zoom level

        >> By using 1fr as the maximum value the space is equally distributed
