        background-size property is specified in one of the following ways: 
            >> Using the keyword values contain or cover
            >> Using a width value only, in which case the height defaults to auto
            >> Using both a width and a height value, in which case the first sets the width and the second sets the height
            >> Each value can be a <length>, a <percentage>, or auto
        >> To specify the size of multiple background images, separate the value for each one with a comma
        >> Values: 
            >> contain: 
                >> Scales the image as large as possible within its container without cropping or stretching the image
                >> If the container is larger than the image, this will result in image tiling, unless the background-repeat property is set to no-repeat
            >> cover: 
                >> Scales the image (while preserving its ratio) to the smallest possible size to fill the container (that is: both its height and width completely cover the container), leaving no empty space
                >> If the proportions of the background differ from the element, the image is cropped either vertically or horizontally
            >> auto: 
                >> Scales the background image in the corresponding direction such that its intrinsic proportions are maintained
            >> <length>: 
                >> Stretches the image in the corresponding dimension to the specified length
                >> Negative values are not allowed
            >> <percentage>: 
                >> Stretches the image in the corresponding dimension to the specified percentage of the background positioning area
                >> background positioning area is determined by the value of background-origin (by default, the padding box)
                >> However, if the background's background-attachment value is fixed, the positioning area is instead the entire viewport
                >> Negative values are not allowed
        >> Intrinsic dimensions and proportions: 
            >> computation of values depends on the image's intrinsic dimensions (width and height) and intrinsic proportions (width-to-height ratio)
            >> These attributes are as follows: 
                >> A bitmap image (such as JPG) always has intrinsic dimensions and proportions
                >> A vector image (such as SVG) does not necessarily have intrinsic dimensions
                    >> If it has both horizontal and vertical intrinsic dimensions, it also has intrinsic proportions
                    >> If it has no dimensions or only one dimension, it may or may not have proportions
                >> CSS <gradient>s have no intrinsic dimensions or intrinsic proportions
                >> Background images created with the element() function use the intrinsic dimensions and proportions of the generating element
        >> Based on the intrinsic dimensions and proportions, the rendered size of the background image is computed as follows:
            >> If both components of background-size are specified and are not auto: 
                >> background image is rendered at the specified size
            >> If the background-size is contain or cover: 
                >> While preserving its intrinsic proportions, the image is rendered at the largest size contained within, or covering, the background positioning area
                >> If the image has no intrinsic proportions, then it's rendered at the size of the background positioning area
            >> If the background-size is auto or auto auto: 
                >> If the image has both horizontal and vertical intrinsic dimensions, it's rendered at that size
                >> If the image has no intrinsic dimensions and has no intrinsic proportions, it's rendered at the size of the background positioning area
                >> If the image has no intrinsic dimensions but has intrinsic proportions, it's rendered as if contain had been specified instead
                >> If the image has only one intrinsic dimension and has intrinsic proportions, it's rendered at the size corresponding to that one dimension
                    >> other dimension is computed using the specified dimension and the intrinsic proportions.
                >> If the image has only one intrinsic dimension but has no intrinsic proportions, it's rendered using the specified dimension and the other dimension of the background positioning area
                >> SVG images have a preserveAspectRatio attribute that defaults to the equivalent of contain; an explicit background-size causes preserveAspectRatio to be ignored
            >> If the background-size has one auto component and one non-auto component:
                >> If the image has intrinsic proportions, it's stretched to the specified dimension
                    >>  unspecified dimension is computed using the specified dimension and the intrinsic proportions
            >> If the image has no intrinsic proportions, it's stretched to the specified dimension, if there is one    
                >> If there is no such intrinsic dimension, it becomes the corresponding dimension of the background positioning area
            
            >> Working with gradients: 
                >> If you use a <gradient> as the background and specify a background-size to go with it, it's best not to specify a size that uses a single auto component, or is specified using only a width value (for example, background-size: 50%)
                >> e.g. .gradient-example {
                            width: 50px;

                    >> Essentially what happens is the background image dimension is subtracted from the corresponding container dimension, and then a percentage of the resulting value is used as the direct offset from the left (or top) edge
                        >> (container width - image width) * (position x%) = (x offset value)
                           (container height - image height) * (position y%) = (y offset value)
                        >> Using the X axis for an example, let's say we have an image that is 300px wide and we are using it in a container that is 100px wide, with background-size set to auto:
                            >> 100px - 300px = -200px (container & image difference)
                            >> So that with position percentages of -25%, 0%, 50%, 100%, 125%, we get these image-to-container edge offset values: 
                                >>  -200px * -25% = 50px
                                    -200px * 0% = 0px
                                    -200px * 50% = -100px
                                    -200px * 100% = -200px
                                    -200px * 125% = -250px
                            >> So with these resultant values for our example, the left edge of the image is offset from the left edge of the container by: 
                                >> + 50px (putting the left image edge in the center of the 100-pixel-wide container)
                                >> 0px (left image edge coincident with the left container edge)
                                >> -100px (left image edge 100px to the left of the container, in this example that means the middle 100px image area is centered in the container)
                                >> -200px (left image edge 200px to the left of the container, in this example that means the right image edge is coincident with the right container edge)
                                >> -250px (left image edge 250px to the left of the container, in this example that puts the right edge of the 300px-wide image in the center of the container)
                    >> It's worth mentioning that if your background-size is equal to the container size for a given axis, then a percentage position for that axis will have no effect because the "container-image difference" will be zero
