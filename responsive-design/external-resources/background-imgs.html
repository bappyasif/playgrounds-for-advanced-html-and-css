        background-size: 

        >> background-size CSS property sets the size of the element's background image
        >> image can be left to its natural size, stretched, or constrained to fit the available space
        >> Spaces not covered by a background image are filled with the background-color property
        >> and the background color will be visible behind background images that have transparency/translucency

        Syntax: 
        /* Keyword values */
        background-size: cover;
        background-size: contain;

        /* One-value syntax */
        /* the width of the image (height becomes 'auto') */
        background-size: 50%;
        background-size: 3.2em;
        background-size: 12px;
        background-size: auto;

        /* Two-value syntax */
        /* first value: width of the image, second value: height */
        background-size: 50% auto;
        background-size: 3em 25%;
        background-size: auto 6px;
        background-size: auto auto;

        /* Multiple backgrounds */
        background-size: auto, auto; /* Not to be confused with `auto auto` */
        background-size: 50%, 25%, 25%;
        background-size: 6px, auto, contain;

        /* Global values */
        background-size: inherit;
        background-size: initial;
        background-size: revert;
        background-size: revert-layer;
        background-size: unset;
        
        background-size property is specified in one of the following ways: 
            >> Using the keyword values contain or cover
            >> Using a width value only, in which case the height defaults to auto
            >> Using both a width and a height value, in which case the first sets the width and the second sets the height
            >> Each value can be a <length>, a <percentage>, or auto
        >> To specify the size of multiple background images, separate the value for each one with a comma
        >> Values: 
            >> contain: 
                >> Scales the image as large as possible within its container without cropping or stretching the image
                >> If the container is larger than the image, this will result in image tiling, unless the background-repeat property is set to no-repeat
            >> cover: 
                >> Scales the image (while preserving its ratio) to the smallest possible size to fill the container (that is: both its height and width completely cover the container), leaving no empty space
                >> If the proportions of the background differ from the element, the image is cropped either vertically or horizontally
            >> auto: 
                >> Scales the background image in the corresponding direction such that its intrinsic proportions are maintained
            >> <length>: 
                >> Stretches the image in the corresponding dimension to the specified length
                >> Negative values are not allowed
            >> <percentage>: 
                >> Stretches the image in the corresponding dimension to the specified percentage of the background positioning area
                >> background positioning area is determined by the value of background-origin (by default, the padding box)
                >> However, if the background's background-attachment value is fixed, the positioning area is instead the entire viewport
                >> Negative values are not allowed
        >> Intrinsic dimensions and proportions: 
            >> computation of values depends on the image's intrinsic dimensions (width and height) and intrinsic proportions (width-to-height ratio)
            >> These attributes are as follows: 
                >> A bitmap image (such as JPG) always has intrinsic dimensions and proportions
                >> A vector image (such as SVG) does not necessarily have intrinsic dimensions
                    >> If it has both horizontal and vertical intrinsic dimensions, it also has intrinsic proportions
                    >> If it has no dimensions or only one dimension, it may or may not have proportions
                >> CSS <gradient>s have no intrinsic dimensions or intrinsic proportions
                >> Background images created with the element() function use the intrinsic dimensions and proportions of the generating element
        >> Based on the intrinsic dimensions and proportions, the rendered size of the background image is computed as follows:
            >> If both components of background-size are specified and are not auto: 
                >> background image is rendered at the specified size
            >> If the background-size is contain or cover: 
                >> While preserving its intrinsic proportions, the image is rendered at the largest size contained within, or covering, the background positioning area
                >> If the image has no intrinsic proportions, then it's rendered at the size of the background positioning area
            >> If the background-size is auto or auto auto: 
                >> If the image has both horizontal and vertical intrinsic dimensions, it's rendered at that size
                >> If the image has no intrinsic dimensions and has no intrinsic proportions, it's rendered at the size of the background positioning area
                >> If the image has no intrinsic dimensions but has intrinsic proportions, it's rendered as if contain had been specified instead
                >> If the image has only one intrinsic dimension and has intrinsic proportions, it's rendered at the size corresponding to that one dimension
                    >> other dimension is computed using the specified dimension and the intrinsic proportions.
                >> If the image has only one intrinsic dimension but has no intrinsic proportions, it's rendered using the specified dimension and the other dimension of the background positioning area
                >> SVG images have a preserveAspectRatio attribute that defaults to the equivalent of contain; an explicit background-size causes preserveAspectRatio to be ignored
            >> If the background-size has one auto component and one non-auto component:
                >> If the image has intrinsic proportions, it's stretched to the specified dimension
                    >>  unspecified dimension is computed using the specified dimension and the intrinsic proportions
            >> If the image has no intrinsic proportions, it's stretched to the specified dimension, if there is one    
                >> If there is no such intrinsic dimension, it becomes the corresponding dimension of the background positioning area
            
            >> Working with gradients: 
                >> If you use a <gradient> as the background and specify a background-size to go with it, it's best not to specify a size that uses a single auto component, or is specified using only a width value (for example, background-size: 50%)
                >> e.g. .gradient-example {
                            width: 50px;
                            height: 100px;
                            background-image: linear-gradient(blue, red);

                            /* Not safe to use */
                            background-size: 25px;
                            background-size: 50%;
                            background-size: auto 50px;
                            background-size: auto 50%;

                            /* Safe to use */
                            background-size: 25px 50px;
                            background-size: 50% 50%;
                        }
                >> Note that it's particularly not recommended to use a pixel dimension and an auto dimension with a <gradient>, because it's impossible to replicate rendering
            
            Formal definition: 
            >> Initial value	auto auto
            >> Applies to	all elements
            >> Inherited	no
            >> Percentages	relative to the background positioning area
            >> Computed value	as specified, but with relative lengths converted into absolute lengths
            >> Animation type	repeatable list of simple list of length, percentage, or calc
