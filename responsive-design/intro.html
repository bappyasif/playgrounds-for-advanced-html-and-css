    <!-- 
        Terminology: 
        >> “Responsive Design” is the term used to describe creating websites that respond to changes in browser size in order to create something that works on any device
        >> here we're not going to focus much on the actual design of responsive websites, but the techniques you can use to implement responsiveness on websites
        >> There are ways to make your designs flexible enough that they work well on most screens, and there are ways to dramatically change the layout of your page at certain sizes
        
        What screens sizes should you support?
        >> smallest phones in common circulation rarely get smaller than 320px, so that should serve as a reliable lower end target
        >> If your website works as low as 320px width, then it should work on any small device
        >> upper limit is a little harder to clarify
        >> These days super-duper-ultra-wide monitors aren’t uncommon, so you should plan for the possibility that your site could be viewed on some ridiculously wide monitor
        >> Often, this is accomplished by setting up a max-width for all of your content and then centering that on the page

     <!-- 
        >> As more diverse screen sizes became available, the concept of responsive web design (RWD) appeared, a set of practices that allows web pages to alter their layout and appearance to suit different screen widths, resolutions, etc
        >> It is an idea that changed the way we design for a multi-device web
        
        Historic website layouts: 
        >> HTML is fundamentally responsive
        >> If you create a web page containing text and resize the browser window, or display the page on a device with a smaller screen, then the browser will automatically reflow the text to fit the window
        >> This is called a liquid layout
            >> problem with this layout, though, is that the site would look squashed on smaller screens and have unreadably long line lengths on larger ones
        >> alternative is to create a fixed width layout, which sets elements to a fixed size in pixels
            >> problem with this approach is that you will get a horizontal scrollbar on screens smaller than the site width, and lots of white space at the edges of the design on larger screens
        >> As the mobile web started to become a reality with the first feature phones, companies who wished to embrace mobile would generally create a special mobile version of their site, with a different URL (often something like m.example.com, or example.mobi)
            >> This meant that two separate versions of the site had to be developed and kept up-to-date
        >> In addition, these mobile sites often offered a very cut down experience

        responsive design: 
        >> term responsive design described the use of three techniques in combination: 
            >> first was the idea of fluid grids
            >> second technique was the idea of fluid images
                >> Using a very simple technique of setting the max-width property to 100%, images would scale down smaller if their containing column became narrower than the image's intrinsic size, but never grow larger
                >> This enables an image to scale down to fit in a flexibly-sized column, rather than overflow it, but not grow larger and become pixelated if the column becomes wider than the image
            >> third key component was the media query
                >> Media Queries enable the type of layout switch using only CSS
                >> Rather than having one layout for all screen sizes, the layout could be changed
                >> Sidebars could be repositioned for the smaller screen, or alternate navigation could be displayed
        >> It is important to understand that responsive web design isn't a separate technology
            >> it is a term used to describe an approach to web design or a set of best practices
            >> used to create a layout that can respond to the device being used to view the content
        
        >> Media Queries: 
        >> Responsive design was only able to emerge due to the media query
        >> Media Queries allow us to run a series of tests (e.g. whether the user's screen is greater than a certain width, or a certain resolution) and apply CSS selectively to style the page appropriately for the user's needs
        >> For example, the following media query tests to see if the current web page is being displayed as screen media (therefore not a printed document) and the viewport is at least 800 pixels wide
            @media screen and (min-width: 800px) { .container { margin: 1em 2em; } }
        >> You can add multiple media queries within a stylesheet, tweaking your whole layout or parts of it to best suit the various screen sizes
        >> points at which a media query is introduced, and the layout changed, are known as breakpoints
        >> A common approach when using Media Queries is to create a simple single-column layout for narrow-screen devices (e.g. mobile phones), then check for larger screens and implement a multiple-column layout when you know that you have enough screen width to handle it
            >> This is often described as mobile first design
        
        Flexible grids: 
        >> Responsive sites don't just change their layout between breakpoints, they are built on flexible grids
        >> A flexible grid means that you don't need to target every possible device size that there is, and build a pixel perfect layout for it
        >> By using a flexible grid, you only need to add in a breakpoint and change the design at the point where the content starts to look bad
        >> In the early days of responsive design, our only option for performing layout was to use floats
        >> Flexible floated layouts were achieved by giving each element a percentage width, and ensuring that across the layout the totals were not more than 100%
        >> It is likely that you will come across websites using this approach in your work, so it is worth understanding it, even though you would not build a modern site using a float-based flexible grid
        

        Modern layout technologies: 
        >> Modern layout methods such as Multiple-column layout, Flexbox, and Grid are responsive by default
        
        >> Multicol: 
        >> oldest of these layout methods is multicol — when you specify a column-count, this indicates how many columns you want your content to be split into
        >> browser then works out the size of these, a size that will change according to the screen size
            >> e.g. .container { column-count: 3; }
        >> If you instead specify a column-width, you are specifying a minimum width
        >> browser will create as many columns of that width as will comfortably fit into the container, then share out the remaining space between all the columns
        >> Therefore the number of columns will change according to how much space there is
            >> e.g. .container { column-width: 10em; }
        
        >> Flexbox: 
        >> In Flexbox, flex items will shrink and distribute space between the items according to the space in their container, as their initial behavior
        >> By changing the values for flex-grow and flex-shrink you can indicate how you want the items to behave when they encounter more or less space around them
        >> In the example below the flex items will each take an equal amount of space in the flex container, using the shorthand of flex: 1 
            >> e.g. .container { display: flex; } .item { flex: 1; }
        
        >> CSS grid: 
        >> In CSS Grid Layout the fr unit allows the distribution of available space across grid tracks
        >> next example creates a grid container with three tracks sized at 1fr
        >> This will create three column tracks, each taking one part of the available space in the container
            >> e.g. .container { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; }

        Responsive images: 
        >> simplest approach to responsive images was, you would take an image that was at the largest size that might be needed, and scale it down
        >> This is still an approach used today, and in most stylesheets, you will find the following CSS somewhere: img { max-width: 100%; }
        >> There are obvious downsides to this approach
            >> image might be displayed a lot smaller than its intrinsic size, which is a waste of bandwidth — a mobile user may be downloading an image several times the size of what they actually see in the browser window
            >> In addition, you may not want the same image aspect ratio on mobile as on desktop
            >> For example, it might be nice to have a square image for mobile, but show the same scene as a landscape image on desktop
            >> Or, acknowledging the smaller size of an image on mobile you might want to show a different image altogether, one which is more easily understood at a small screen size
            >> These things can't be achieved by scaling down an image
        >> Responsive Images, using the <picture> element and the <img> srcset and sizes attributes solve both of these problems
            >> You can provide multiple sizes along with "hints" (metadata that describes the screen size and resolution the image is best suited for)
            >> and the browser will choose the most appropriate image for each device, ensuring that a user will download an image size appropriate for the device they are using
        
        Responsive typography: 
        >> Essentially, this describes changing font sizes within media queries to reflect lesser or greater amounts of screen real estate
        >> In this example, we want to set our level 1 heading to be 4rem, meaning it will be four times our base font size
        >> That's a really large heading! We only want this jumbo heading on larger screen sizes, therefore we first create a smaller heading then use media queries to overwrite it with the larger size if we know that the user has a screen size of at least 1200px
            >>  
                html { font-size: 1em; }

                h1 { font-size: 2rem; }

                @media (min-width: 1200px) { h1 { font-size: 4rem; } }
        >> As this approach to typography shows, you do not need to restrict media queries to only changing the layout of the page
        >> They can be used to tweak any element to make it more usable or attractive at alternate screen sizes

        Using viewport units for responsive typography: 
        >> An interesting approach is to use the viewport unit vw to enable responsive typography
        >> 1vw is equal to one percent of the viewport width, meaning that if you set your font size using vw, it will always relate to the size of the viewport
            >> e.g. h1 { font-size: 6vw; }
        >> problem with doing the above is that the user loses the ability to zoom any text set using the vw unit, as that text is always related to the size of the viewport
        >> Therefore you should never set text using viewport units alone
        >> There is a solution, and it involves using calc()
            >> If you add the vw unit to a value set using a fixed size such as ems or rems then the text will still be zoomable
            >> Essentially, the vw unit adds on top of that zoomed value: h1 { font-size: calc(1.5rem + 3vw); }
        >> This means that we only need to specify the font size for the heading once, rather than set it up for mobile and redefine it in the media queries
        >> font then gradually increases as you increase the size of the viewport

        viewport meta tag: 
        >> If you look at the HTML source of a responsive page, you will usually see the following <meta> tag in the <head> of the document
            >> e.g. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
            >> This meta tag tells mobile browsers that they should set the width of the viewport to the device width, and scale the document to 100% of its intended size, which shows the document at the mobile-optimized size that you intended
        >> This meta tag exists because when the original iPhone launched and people started to view websites on a small phone screen, most sites were not mobile optimized
        >> mobile browser would, therefore, set the viewport width to 980 pixels, render the page at that width, and show the result as a zoomed-out version of the desktop layout
        >> Other mobile browsers (e.g. on Google Android) did the same thing
        >> Users could zoom in and pan around the website to view the bits they were interested in, but it looked bad
        >> trouble is that your responsive design with breakpoints and media queries won't work as intended on mobile browsers
        >> If you've got a narrow screen layout that kicks in at 480px viewport width or less, and the viewport is set at 980px, you'll never see your narrow screen layout on mobile
        >> By setting width=device-width you are overriding Apple's default width=980px with the actual width of the device, so your media queries will work as intended
        >> So you should always include the above line of HTML in the head of your documents
        >> There are other settings you can use with the viewport meta tag, however in general the above line is what you will want to use: 
            >> initial-scale: Sets the initial zoom of the page, which we set to 1
            >> height: Sets a specific height for the viewport
            >> minimum-scale: Sets the minimum zoom level
            >> maximum-scale: Sets the maximum zoom level
            >> user-scalable: Prevents zooming if set to no
        >> You should avoid using minimum-scale, maximum-scale, and in particular setting user-scalable to no
        >> Users should be allowed to zoom as much or as little as they need to; preventing this causes accessibility problems

        Summary: 
        >> Responsive design refers to a site or application design that responds to the environment in which it is viewed
        >> It encompasses a number of CSS and HTML features and techniques and is now essentially just how we build websites by default
        >> It has also become much easier to achieve responsive designs with the help of the layout methods
        >> While the historical articles are still useful, modern use of CSS and HTML makes it far easier to create elegant and useful designs, no matter what device your visitor views the site with
